# Jake's Hubitat Add Ons

This repo holds Apps and Device for the Hubitat platform. It started due to a selfish need to control Wyze Color Bulbs. It may end there, it may not.

## Current Packages

* [**WyzeHub**](https://github.com/jakelehner/Hubitat/tree/master/WyzeHub) - An _unofficial_ Hubitat implementation for Wyze devices.
